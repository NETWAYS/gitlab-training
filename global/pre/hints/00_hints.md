# Training Hints

* Ask questions! Dumb questions do not exist.
* Add your own notes! Having learnt something is reflected best with your own additions.
* Join the conversation! Many of these exercises require real world scenarios and your feedback and questions.
* Work together! Be part of the training team and find solutions together.
