# Work on Git History

* `git commit`
 * Selected changes from the staging area
 * All changes (`-a`) not necessarily added to the staging area
* Verbose mode shows changes compared to latest commit (`-v`)
* Uses the configured editor (vim, nano, etc.)
 * `-m` allows for a short commit message without editor view

Commits use the `user.name` and `user.email` settings to qualify
you as the author of this change. In addition to that the date
and time is stored.

`git commit` collects and records all changes stages for commit. It uses the configured
user name and email address as commit author. This command opens the configured editor
requiring you to add a commit message.

### Add/modify file

    @@@ Sh
    $ cd $HOME/training

    $ vim README.md

    `git commit` also has `-a` which should be used with care.

    $ git add README.md

### Commit the changed file

    @@@ Sh
    $ git status
    $ git commit -v README.md
      Update training notes

      My first commit :)


    Save and exit.

### Verify the Git history

    @@@ Sh
    $ git log
