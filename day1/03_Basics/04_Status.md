### Change files

    @@@ Sh
    $ cd $HOME/training

    $ vim README.md
    # Git Training Notes

    I've learned about `git add` already

    ```
    git status
    ```

Modify and save the file.

### Use git status

    @@@ Sh
    $ git status

You'll recognize the unstaged changes compared to your staging area.

### Add the change to the staging area

    @@@ Sh
    $ git add README.md

### Use git status again

    @@@ Sh
    $ git status

# Examine the current state: Diff

* `git diff`
  * Compare changes between modified working tree and latest commit
  * Output is a unified diff similar to `diff -ur file1 file2`

Later we will learn how to compare specific commits and branches too.

~~~SECTION:handouts~~~

****

`git diff` shows changes between the current working tree and the last commit. You can
also compare specific commits

### Change files

    @@@ Sh
    $ vim README.md

    I've also learned the difference between local changes and the staging area.

Modify and save the file.

### Use git diff

    @@@ Sh
    $ git diff

You'll recognize the unstaged changes compared to your staging area.

### Add the change to the staging area

    @@@ Sh
    $ git add README.md

### Use git diff again

    @@@ Sh
    $ git diff

### Use git diff --staged

    @@@ Sh
    $ git diff --staged

This compares the staged changes for the commit with the latest committed changes.
