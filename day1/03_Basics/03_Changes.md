# Add current changes

* `git add`
  * Add new files to Git (staged)
  * Add modified file(s) from the working directory into the staging index
  * `-A` adds all files. Question: Where is this applicable?
* `git mv`
  * Rename file(s) tracked by Git

~~~SECTION:handouts~~~

****

`git add` will add the file(s) and their content to the staging index
waiting for the commit. This applies to both, new files and also modified
files.

If you're using `-A` to add all files, you need to ensure that
unwanted files are not added. Learn more about `git reset` in the next
slide to selectively unstage added changes.

`git mv` renames an existing file tracking the change for the commit. If you
manually move the file, you will need to rm and add it again.

# Lab ~~~SECTION:MAJOR~~~.~~~SECTION:MINOR~~~: Add a new README.md file

* Objective:
 * Add a new README.md file
* Steps:
 * Change into `$HOME/training`
 * Create README.md and add `# GitLab Training Notes` as first line
 * Use `git add` to add README.md to the current change index
* Next steps:
 * Verify the change with `git status`

Best practice is to have a README.md file written in Markdown
in every project. This gets rendered by GitHub/GitLab in readable HTML.

During this training we will learn many new things. Keep notes
in the `README.md` file.

# Remove changes

* `git reset`
  * Reset files added to the staging index
  * Hint: This comes in handy with `git add -A` before
* `git rm`
  * Remove the file(s) from working tree and Git repository
  * Note that file(s) will be visible in Git history, and can be restored from it
* `git rm --cached`
  * Alternative suggested by Git CLI for `git reset`

~~~SECTION:handouts~~~

****

`git reset` resets files added to the staging index. You can also use it to
reset commits from the history.

This also is helpful when you need to add 95 out of 100 changes. First, use `git add -A`
and then selectively unstage the unwanted 5 changes.

`git rm` removes the file from the working tree and also from the git index.
