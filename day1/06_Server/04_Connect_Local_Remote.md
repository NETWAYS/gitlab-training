# Connect Local Repository to Remote Server

* Local standalone repository
* Connect to remote server
* Clone, Pull, Fetch, Push via SSH/HTTPS

You can also start fresh without any local repository
and clone that from remote.

For training purposes we've started to work offline in `$HOME/training`.
Now we want to publish the local commits to a newly created Git repository
in GitLab.

# Requirements

* SSH or HTTPS auth
  * NWS apps come pre-defined with HTTPS clone/fetch only.
* New GitLab repository for this user
* Configure local repository for the remote server

# SSH Keys

Generate a new SSH key pair on your client.

```
ssh-keygen
```

Copy the public key into your GitLab settings.

```
cat $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

## Create a new GitLab project for the current user

****
### Add Project

GitLab 10.x provides `New Project` underneath the `+` icon
in the top menu bar, next to the search form.

Fill in the `Project name` form with `training` and leave the
other options as default.

### Project View

You'll notice the `HTTPS` URL centered below the project name.

We will be using this remote URL for connecting our local repository
in the next step.

Right now the repository is empty and does not contain any file.
GitLab offers you to add new files, e.g. a README.md file or LICENSE details
directly in the browser. In the background, it is still comitting
the changes to the Git repository.

## Add the repository as remote origin

****

### Add the remote origin

    @@@ Sh
    $ cd $HOME/training.git
    $ git remote add origin https://[...].nws.netways.de/root/training.git
    $ git fetch

### Push the history

    @@@ Sh
    $ git push

This will not work since the local branch does not follow the remote branch.
Use `--set-upstream` as proposed by the cli output. Short form is `-u`.

    @@@ Sh
    $ git push --set-upstream origin master

### Set default push method

Git versions prior 2.0 did not define the default push method. The default behaviour
was to use the same local branch name for the remote branch name.

The new default method should be `simple` which ensures that the local branches
will only be pushed to remote branches which `git pull` is following.

Our setup did not clone the repository (which includes a virtual git pull). Therefore
the local master branch does not follow a remote branch.

In order to fix that, add the default push method to your global configuration.

    @@@ Sh
    git config --global push.default simple

### Push and update all branches

`git push -u origin master` creates a new remote branch, updates the tracking to the
local current branch and pushes all references/commits.

If you want to sync all local branches, you can omit the branch name in the command and
use `--all` instead.

    @@@ Sh
    git push -u origin --all

Keep in mind that syncing all your local branches might create unwanted remote branches.
Those can be there just for testing things, or are not meant for the public domain.

### Project History

Choose `History` and look at the Git commits, their author, subject and timestamp.

Compare it with the local `git log` or `tig` entries. 

### GitLab Graphs

Navigate into `Repository > Graph` to get an alternative history view.
