Compared to other VCS systems, Git provides the advantage of
also storing a local copy of the repository and branches.

That way a developer can work isolated on changes on its own
while other developers can do the same. These isolated environments
ensure that each developers works independantly from other
changes in the project.

In addition to that the Git branching model provides a fail-safe mechanism
for integrating and sharing code changes between repositories.

### Clone the central repository

    @@@ Sh
    $ git clone git@localhost:/opt/git/training.git training-collab1

### Add/modify a file

    @@@ Sh
    $ cat "Training Test" > michaelfriedrich

### Commit the change

    @@@ Sh
    $ git add -A .
    $ git commit -av -m "My test commit"

### Push the changes to the rempote repository

    @@@ Sh
    $ git push origin master

### Repeat these steps with training-collab2

    @@@ Sh
    $ git clone git@localhost:/opt/git/training.git training-collab2

# Lab ~~~SECTION:MAJOR~~~.~~~SECTION:MINOR~~~: Resolve conflicts in a central repository

* Objective:
 * Rebase your local history with the remote repository
* Steps:
 * Fetch the changes
 * Rebase the master branch against `origin/master`
 * Resolve possible merge conflicts
 * Push your rebased history

~~~SECTION:handouts~~~

****
Instead of `git fetch` and `git rebase` you can also use
the `git pull` command with the additional `--rebase` flag.
This helps if you are familiar with SVN and `svn update`.

If you forget the `--rebase` flag it will still work
but generate merge commits. This will merge your commits
in historical order but not rebase them on top of the existing
history.

For using a centralized workflow it is better to use `rebase`
instead of generating a merge commit.

### Fetch the remote changes

    @@@ Sh
    $ git fetch

### Rebase your local history

    @@@ Sh
    $ git rebase origin/master

### Resolve merge probblems

    @@@ Sh
    $ git status

Search for conflicts in vim:

    />>>

Resolve the conflicts, add the file and continue the rebase.

    @@@ Sh
    $ git add <problem file>
    $ git rebase --continue


### Push the changes to the remote repository

    $ git push origin master
