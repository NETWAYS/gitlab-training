# Feature Branch Workflow

* Feature development takes place in dedicated branches
* Does not interfere with the main codebase
* Master branch does not contain broken code
* Feature branches can be rebased against stable master branch on demand

# Feature Branch Workflow - How it works

* Central repository
* Create a new branch for each feature
* Descriptive branch names, e.g. `feature/cool-issue-10718`
* Changes in a feature branch similar to centralized workflow
* Push feature branches to central repository for collaboration with other developers

## Use Feature Branches

****

### Create a new branch

The new branch `my-feature` will be based on the `master` branch.

    @@@ Sh
    $ git checkout -b my-feature master

### Add and commit changes

    @@@ Sh
    $ cat "# TODOs for feature" > feature.md
    $ git add feature.md
    $ git commit -v -m "Start my feature"

### Push your feature branch

    @@@ Sh
    $ git push --set-upstream origin my-feature

# Lab ~~~SECTION:MAJOR~~~.~~~SECTION:MINOR~~~: Merge Feature Branches

* Objective:
 * Update master branch and merge feature branch

* Steps:
 * Checkout the `master` branch
 * Add, commit and push changes
 * Checkout your feature branch (hint: `git branch` lists all branches)
 * Diff your feature branch to the current master
 * Checkout the `master` branch
 * Merge the feature branch
 * Show the graphical history with `git log --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit --graph`

## Merge Feature Branches

****

### Checkout the master branch and add changes

    @@@ Sh
    $ git checkout master
    $ cat "master" > file
    $ git add file
    $ git commit -v -m "Add master fix"
    $ git push origin master

### Checkout the feature branch and compare it with the master branch

    @@@ Sh
    $ git branch
    $ git checkout my-feature
    $ git diff master my-feature

### Checkout the master and merge the feature branch

    @@@ Sh
    $ git checkout master
    $ git merge my-feature

### Examine the history

    @@@ Sh
    $ git log --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit --graph
