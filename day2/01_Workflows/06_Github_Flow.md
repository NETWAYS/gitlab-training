# Forking Workflow - Multiple Remote Repositories

* **Multiple** remote repositories
 * `origin` is yours, e.g. https://github.com:dnsmichi/icinga2.git
 * `upstream` is official with releases, e.g. https://github.com/icinga/icinga2.git
* Merge branches from `origin/<branch>` to `upstream/<branch>` and vice versa

Example:

    $ git remote -v
    origin	https://github.com:dnsmichi/icinga2.git (fetch)
    origin	https://github.com:dnsmichi/icinga2.git (push)
    upstream	https://github.com/icinga/icinga2.git (fetch)
    upstream	https://github.com/icinga/icinga2.git (push)

**Forking Workflow - Keep in Sync**

* Pull changes from `upstream` HEAD to own repository main branch to sync development
* Remote `HEAD` is the default branch for this repository, usually `main`
* Remember, HEAD is just a smart pointer. You can use a branch name too

Example:

    $ git checkout main
    $ git fetch upstream
    $ git pull upstream HEAD
    $ git push origin main
