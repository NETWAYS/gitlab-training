 * Edit `README.md`, add, commit and push the changes
 * Open the proposed GitLab URL in your browser
 * Fill in the merge request and add `fixes #1` as description
 * Merge the MR and tick `delete source branch`
 * Analyze the history in GitLab/tig and open issue #1

* Bonus:
 * Run `git fetch --prune` and `git branch -d feature/docs-merge-request`

~~~SECTION:handouts~~~

For future branch cleanups, you'll need to compare the deleted
remote branch references from `git fetch --prune` with the local
branch names, review them and then delete them.

### Checkout the feature branch, add, commit and push changes

    @@@ Sh
    $ cd $HOME/training
    $ git checkout main
    $ git checkout -b feature/docs-merge-request
    $ vim README.md

    Let's create a merge request with GitLab.

    $ git add README.md
    $ git commit -v README.md -m "Update docs for merge requests"
    $ git push -u origin feature/docs-merge-request

### Navigate into GitLab and create merge request

GitLab puts the URL into the shell output when pushing the branch.

     * [new branch]      feature/docs-merge-request -> feature/docs-merge-request
    Branch 'feature/docs-merge-request' set up to track remote branch 'feature/docs-merge-request' from 'origin'.


Open the URL in your browser.

Specify a topic and description. Add `fixes #1` into the MR's description.

Create the merge request. Add a comment inline to the source code
and see what happens in the interface.

Merge the MR and tick `delete source branch`.

Open the previously created issue and verify that is was closed
by merging the MR.


### Update local index and delete the branch

    @@@ Sh
    $ git fetch --prune
    $ git branch -d feature/docs-merge-request

### Pull changes to local main after merge

    @@@ Sh
    $ git checkout main
    $ git pull
    $ tig
