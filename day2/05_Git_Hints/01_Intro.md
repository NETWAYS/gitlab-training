# Best Practices

* Set user configuration (name, email)
* Always keep good commits in mind
* Do not commit all changes at once - use staging with `git add` and then `git commit`

* Work with branches (features, bugfixes, etc.) whenever possible
* Rebase branches against master prior to merging a merge request
* Always force a merge commit with `--no-ff` to keep history trees in graphs
